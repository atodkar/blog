# Blog
This blog is to track every week's writing in order to track learning every week. This will then be converted into more mature blog later.
There is no content restriction on what should be tracked and captured in this writing. While most of stuff will be technical and information related, it might also contain some experiences which are worth sharing.

### Topics
Currently I am working on IoT and analytics vertical so most of writing will be based on those learning and findings but sometimes writing can go in direction of Python, Java, C++ and other programming languages.

### Motivation
I want to improve my writing skills as well as keep track of what I am learning so I can refer to this knowledge base whenever required in future. This will also help others with similar problems to get opinions of co-minded fellow.

### Wiki
All pages can be seen on wiki section of this github repository.
